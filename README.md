 ## Disable the middle mouse button paste in Terminal!
 I kept accidentally pasting text into my terminal window when using a mouse. With no way to adjust the mouse wheel's sensitivity or disable the paste option in Terminal, I tried to find another way to disable that "feature"...

Please note that this needs **[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)** for macOS installed to work.

## To use
1. Copy `disable-middle-paste.json` to `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`
2. Go to Complex modifications in Karabiner-Elements Preferences
3. Click Add rule
4. Click Enable next to "Disable Middle Mouse Button Paste in Terminal" entry.
